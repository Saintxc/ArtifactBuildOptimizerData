Each JSON stores the data of all the possible armor and artifacts.
* The armor JSON only has armors listed that have at least 1 artifact slot.
  * Also stored is the armor total resistances and how many lead container upgrades are possible.
* Every current usable artifact is within the JSON.
  * Currently, there are 75 usable artifacts
* Artifacts excluded are Altered Toast and Heart of Chornobyl.
  * These are excluded because they cannot be equipped and are collectors items or based on choices made during the story.
